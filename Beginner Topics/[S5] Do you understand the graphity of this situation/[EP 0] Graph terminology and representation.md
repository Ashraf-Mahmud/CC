# Introduction to Graph theory
Many programming problems can be solved by modeling them as graph
problems and using appropriate graph algorithms. A typical example of a graph
is a network of roads and cities in a country. Sometimes though, the graph is
hidden in the problem and it may be difficult to detect it.
